# Fire Plus
Resource Pack that Fire is using for some basic things.

### What does it include?

Right now, Fire Plus (Any version, even [**1.2**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/firepack/version/3.2.1-b-1)) only changes loading screen of Minecraft, in the future I have some plans to expand it's features, but right now, it's just an custom loading screen made via [**Puzzle**](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle).
